Generally while doing programming in any language we need to use various variables to store various information.
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store value

	In contrast to other programming languages like C and Java, in R the variables are not declared as some data types. The variables are assigned with R objects and the data types of the R object becomes the data type of variable. There are many types of R objects.
The frequently used ones are 
vectors
list
matrices
arrays
factors
data frames

Vector -  the simplest of these objects is vector object, and there are six datatypes of these atomic vectors also termed as six classes of vectors. These classes are 
	1. logical
	2. numeric
	3. integer
	4. complex
	5. character
	6. raw data


   Q. If you need a vector that contains the number 1, repeatedly exactly 20 times, what is the command for that?
   Q. If you want to create a numeric vector where values 95 and 82 are assigned to maths and science subject, what is the command?
